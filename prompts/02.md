## Problem

Our MCP server currently doesn't do anything. We want to hook it up to GitHub so that it can respond to issues and pull requests.

## Supporting Information

### Octokit

We are using Octokit to interact with GitHub.

`pnpm add octokit`

Octokit methods should be put in their own file, in `src/github.ts`.

```ts
import { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: `personal-access-token123` });
```

Environment variables can be put in a `.env` file.

### `tsx` and `.env`

You can pass `.env` to `tsx` by using the `--env-file` flag.

```bash
tsx watch --env-file=.env src/main.ts
```

### Always Declare Tool Descriptions.

When calling `server.tool()`, you can pass in both a name and a description. For instance:

```ts
server.tool(
  "createPullRequestComment",
  "Create a comment on a pull request",
  {
    owner: z.string(),
    repo: z.string(),
    pullNumber: z.number(),
    body: z.string(),
  },
  async ({ owner, repo, pullNumber, body }) => {
    const comment = await github.createPullRequestComment(
      { owner, repo },
      pullNumber,
      body
    );
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(comment, null, 2) }],
    };
  }
);
```

This should be done for all tools, since it helps the MCP client understand the tool and its capabilities.

## Steps To Complete

- Ensure that `.env` is added to the `.gitignore` file.
- Get the user to add a GitHub token to `.env`.
- Ensure that `.env` is being loaded into the environment when running the `dev` script.
- Install `octokit` as a dependency.
- Create functions for issues and pull requests:
  - `getIssue`: Get an issue by number.
  - `getPullRequest`: Get a pull request by number.
  - `createIssueComment`: Create a comment on an issue.
  - `createPullRequestComment`: Create a comment on a pull request.
  - `updateIssue`: Update an issue.
  - `updatePullRequest`: Update a pull request.
  - `listIssues`: List issues for a repository.
  - `listPullRequests`: List pull requests for a repository.
- Remove the demo tools from the existing MCP server.
- Add those tools to the MCP server.
- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file.
